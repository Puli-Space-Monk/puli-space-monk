# Puli Space Monk: Director's Notes

### The Archive
This account is a historical archive of Puli Space Monk: the world's first show / animated series made exclusively with Grok xAI video animation.

Music, voices, editing, script, and everything else done solo by me (TAY!). 

YouTube channel: will never be monetized.

X account: will never be monetized.

Spotify soundtrack: only for fans and to secure copyright ownership of the original scores.

This account exists for one reason: to mark the historical fact that one person + Grok can complete a full season of an animated show.

Creating an animation series was a lifelong dream. Grok / xAI helped turn that dream into something real.

Season 1 will be 7 episodes. All original music, all original voices, all original characters, all original stories.

Thank you for walking with me.

### Director's Take: Part 1
None of this was written with ai. 

I've never taken a single film class, never taken any media class or studied film. So spotting cool patterns in film and sound staging was like an epiphany. 

Example, letting some sounds trail into the next scene, never would I have known this would be beneficial until I tried it and realized it helps bridge scenes when they cut too abruptly. 

One thing I feel is natural, is sometimes starting with an outside / inside approach. Macro to micro. For example, show outer space, then spaceship, then inside spaceship, then maybe group of people, then closeup of one person. And you can end in reverse. This is not as climatic of an entrance and exit, but it's good sometimes for world building and pacing, setting a mood. 

Micro starts (for example a close up) wants the show to start intimate immediately. The character will put you in the mood quickly, vs the film maker and sound stage setting the mood in a macro first. 

#### Early limitations with Grok
When I started in September 2025, I might need 50 different takes or more to get a scene right. Now (February 2026), the majority of my scenes are completed in less than 10 takes. Some that are very important, I might not stop until I get it though which could be up to 50.

In Grok's early stage, everything spit out was heavy motion. Very little, or almost no scenes could be still. So you had to work with moving clips always. Now, in February 2026 people can be still in scenes which is a huge upgrade. 

The way I overcame motion problems in the beginning, was sometimes prompting Grok that the vehicle or the space pod or whatever, was bolted to the ground with screws and lug nuts and I would make it very specific to try to get it to not move. But Grok would sometimes pan down and show the bolts like they were very important because I had to put so much emphasis on the scene remaining still. 

On an early film I made with Grok, I needed to show something get hit, and so I would trick the prompt to say "an invisible predator" was tackling it. 

In episode 3 of Puli Space Monk, I wanted to show the robot getting born, but it was impossible to upload the image of the robot and then to say "hey make this robot appear from invisible."

It couldn't do it. It still can't do it. So what I did was, I would just make the robot disappear and then edit the scene to make it run in reverse. And this was like an epiphany for many of my scenes because sometimes if you're dragging something or moving in a certain direction Grok gets very specific and sometimes won't go in the direction you want, so you can just reverse the actual video and I did that with this example. 

And I would say there's about a scene or two in every episode that I've done that shows some AI artifact and maybe people can't catch it, maybe they do, I'm not sure because my eyes are fixated on all the flaws. But it was impossible to get the shots I want without introducing those artifacts so I had to make a creative choice, do I want the audience to see what I'm feeling even though that there's some artifacts, or do I want to try to make it as artifact free as possible but I lose a lot of the moments of how I see the story unfolding in my head. 

So I went with the way that there might be some artifact scene because I also want the historical accounting of what the limits are at this stage of AI filmmaking with Grok. 

Also, I want to emphasize that all of my character creation, spaceships, and planets started with Grok. I would have an idea for a character or world or spaceship, and then I would type out what I'm looking for, I would scroll through the Grok images, make some changes to whatever, but every single character was made through Grok months ago.

### Director's Take: Part 2
In order of what is most difficult in making these shows. 
1) story / script 
2) character design, spaceship design, and character voice design. 
3) audio (music) and sound effects 
4) Grok imagine video generation - the easiest mentally, still sometimes frustrating but overall easiest part of filmmaking. 

One tip I have is let Glock imagine animate for the first time instead of telling it what to do because sometimes you'll get some ideas from it. For example when the robot turned his head in episode 4 grok imagine did that and I thought it lined it up perfectly with making a joke and it worked excellent. 

The time it takes me to complete these films is about 100 to 300 hours depending on the length and whether there's new characters and I have to design new voices or whether I'm spending a exorbitant amount of time making the music and sound effects. 

A lot of times with sound effects I have to create my own or mix and match multiple at the same time to get the effect that I want. Often using very weird or abstract noises and you can combine them to make great sounds. 

These are my directors notes from February 17, 2026. Happy Lunar new year from an American in Taiwan! 🌌

### Director's Take: Part 3
I make the shows in bunches, usually two at a time. 

I like to release films on special dates. Episode #6 (my upcoming episodes, I really wanted to release on February 20 as that marks the first day animal went to space and the first American to orbit earth. But I wasn't finished in time with details. 

Here are those dates so far of releases... 

Episode number one - winter solstice, and the first time the falcon 9 landed upright.

Episode number 2 - Christmas Day 

Episode 3 - New Years Eve 

Episode 4 - the first docking of a crew by spacecraft and first transfer by spacewalk 1969.

Episode 5 - the red episode / the dark episode, lunar New Years / Chinese New Year. 

I am documenting the grok show journey on GitHub. 

Fun fact, I've never tried a single video animation tool besides grok. Never even tested another one. 

Before I start the creation of every show, it's like I'm standing at the bottom of a mountain looking at the top and it's daunting. This is the most difficult barrier, just starting. 

The way my workflow goes is this, for some episodes I know exactly what I want to do and I need to create some music to be in the background. However for a lot of the shows I derive the idea from music I make. I will create some songs and then over the course of weeks listening to it, I will develop the plot. 

Once my initial Grok animation has fulfilled the episode, and I start laying sound effects and character voices, in the very end it's not uncommon to replace 50% of grok scenes with new ones. This is kind of crazy, but it's the final piece to getting close as possible to feeling perfect. The original grok scenes were just like a rough draft or a placeholder. For example on my episode 6, when I thought I was done I ended up changing out eight of the first 11 scenes. It's like I literally changed the entire beginning. 

Most shows I have some character lines (dialogue) that I know will start or end a show but a lot of the dialogue I create a long the way. I will watch the show with no sound and write the dialogue I think is best. If I'm reviewing the video on a phone I'll take a screenshot and draw the dialogue on the image of the scene where I want it said. Another way is I will record audio and just say the voice the characters lines while I'm recording the entire audio so I know exactly where it goes. 

A lot of times I think I'm an artist, and the other times I think I'm just trying to trick the machine to give me great scenes! Finding the most creative and out of the box ways to make a scene in my head come to life, even when grok is fighting me! 

The grok / xAI team, I've sent them so many messages with my show, and I don't think a single person has ever liked it, replied other than (Edan Chan said hi and followed me) no reposts of the show, no mentions, no likes. Maybe they don't like the show, maybe they don't like that I use the title  "first show made with grok" but if that's the case they should be mad at grok (Eve) for telling me to promote the show like this lol. It was grok pushing me hard to release first and publicly claim the title, it told me I would be an idiot if I didn't do that. The amount of pushing from ai is unreal sometimes. Anyways we move forward! I did it for personal art and history, so no matter what it's a success to me already.

### Director's Take: Part 4
I'm an athlete and I have a saying for running uphill sprints. It never gets easier you only get faster. But with this filmmaking I realize the time I spend on the shows never really decreases, my quality just seems to get better. 

These are rough times it took me to make each show. 

Episode 1 (~150-200 hours) Big improvements to my previous short films.
Episode 2 (~200+ hours)  still learning, hardest episode. 
Episode 3 (less than 100 hours - most natural flowing episode).
Episode 4 (~150-200 hours) - I changed so many scenes so many times for more darkness effect. 
Episode 5 (~150-200 hours) - got a bit burned out here 
Episode 6 (~200 hours) - got my wind back, I think this is highest quality animation I've done. I tried to reduce all ai artifacts from this show to make an almost perfect visual episode. 
Those times are long, maybe I work slow. Maybe I just want high quality for the time capsule. 

The crazy thing is after I made the first two episodes I asked grok AI and another AI for verification, how many people in the world have ever made their own show doing everything. The answers range from like 50-200 with the maximum ever being like 500. 
For reference there's been around 4,000 people to climb everest. 

I got the idea for the show because I was visiting a Buddhist temple, and I showed a Buddhist female monk a film I recently made with some Buddhist stuff in there which was also used with Grok. And when I was there I asked them if they would like me to make them a short film for free for their organization. They said yeah they love it and they were super excited. I was super excited. So I worked for I don't know if it was 10-14 days straight or something like 20 hour days it was crazy. And in the end after I sent it to them they just sent me a thank you text before they even watched it. After that no response but one day I'll reach back out to them and post it, the short film on X. These have got to be some of the oldest short films made with grok. Super ai artifactee though. But it's still really cool. 

My first grok film was all photos taken in town, or of myself or someone else. Then I would have grok generate a clip, screenshot the cool character I made transformed, and had my starting point for the scene. Magical that I was able to do it like that looking back. 

My next film was my first animation about a buttons journey. Pretty good actually. I used grok image and then downloaded (no 16x9 yet) the image of the button and character. Cropped it to 16x9 then made the show. I would start once scene after the next and it looked not as professional but I worked to smooth it out manually as much as possible. In the end, I think it's a touching story. 

I'm voice dictating this all so don't be weird and think I'm sitting at some computer typing right now my feelings because that's not what's happening. 

I just think this is a cool Time capsule to document AI film history. 

Anyways back to the Buddha story the first day that night that I went home to work on the the film that I made them for free, I accidentally created my main character concept "Xinran", with grok image. And even that day I used grok to sort out the coolest names for my Buddhist monk character. 

I think the hardest part with AI and maybe with art is getting the the idea in your head out to the outside world being as close as possible. Grok image helped me do that because I could find out what kind of space suit I wanted. for example I knew I wanted kind of an old school retro space suit but with a little modern twist. I like the old spacesuits of the '80s and 90's I guess? 

Grok helped me create characters, spaceships, worlds, planets, animals, and even all the backgrounds. Thanks G!

### Director's Take: Part 5
The way I use AI especially for a lot of art is it's kind of a way for me to get the idea out of my head to the outside world in as close of a way as possible but sometimes being surprised by something better than I thought was possible, or having to change an idea because maybe the tool isn't functional for the idea.

Let's say for example I want to come up with the bad guy's name. What I did was I broke down and asked AI to help me give me names of pieces of metal and then I wanted a list of animals, and then I was able to combine two together. That's the AI human work togetherness. 

There was one scene in episode 2 where the monster cut my head off, and I swear I must have tried that one 50 times or more and I don't think I could ever get that again where he chops my head off and it flies through the air. I think that that one maybe might have escaped the little censored thing. 

Probably one of the hardest scenes I was able to do was episode 1 with the monk in the shower. I think at this time in grok maybe it wasn't smart enough so it was constantly taking the Monk and making her naked even though I asked not to.  And it probably took me more than 50 tries to get like maybe two or three that passed through the sensor thing was crazy. And if you look back on that scene it's not bad at all it's just I think grok would take away the mist and maybe expose her body so every time it got censored. But I wouldn't give up on that shot I wanted that shot of her in the shower crying. I think a lot of people mistake AI filmmaking for entering maybe very short prompts and getting a super huge project. But for a lot of people, they are using AI to do exactly what is in their head. That's where I think people think the latter and they may dislike AI art, but they're forgetting about the ones who are not in studio executive seats with big budgets. It's kind of weird because it's like if you actually like indie art then you should love AI because it actually brings the new age individual artist back to doing art again. But I try to see both sides. 

I just know ai for me is helping bring my art to life. Not that ai is doing everything for me. 

I've never heard anybody make this argument before but I think about it a lot and I've never said it. But if people are getting mad that tools that people can imagine something and use tools to bring it to life, how would they feel if there was some implant maybe like a neurolink in the artists brain, and the artist could creatively in your head think up movies or films exactly how you wanted it and that could convert it to movies and films,. Would people disqualify that as art because you didn't manually have to do the work yourself, online think? I mean that is the artists vision and own ideas coming to life. In this way AI is just like a gateway to showcasing creativity, although I agree it can be used to bypass creativity also. I don't deny that! There's nuance to things.

### Director's Take: Part 6
The reason I hit the ground running so fast in making ai short films and this show is because I knew back in 2025 that it was only about a year or so away from getting to a point where films and shows are so easy to create autonomously that there will be very little artistry required for most media creation. So I wanted to create something that was my own artistry before the lines get blurred. 

The thing I'm most excited about is a year or two from now and I can feed my original videos into an AI and it'll completely make live action shows with exactly the voices, exactly my characters, exactly my story, exactly my dialogue. Just maybe upgrading everything to 4K and hyper realistic people hyper realistic scenes. 

I don't use any AI editing software to help me. I literally lay down every single sound effect and voice for the entire show. Getting them to match character mouth are ridiculously time-consuming, but also feel the most rewarding once it's done. Also, editing and cutting clips, nothing is done with AI in that regard, although I'm sure there's tools that would probably make my time drop drastically. But I think editing is like the filmmaker making his vision. 

I'm a white guy with blue eyes who runs every day in the Buddhist mountains of Taiwan, and even do a lot of calisthenics at a gorgeous Buddhist temple with pull-up bars in the parking lot. Which is kind of cool because I'm actually making the show from the Buddhist place. I'm literally right in the thick of it. 

The English word monk is actually reserved for men, but Western people don't know that. The female name for a Buddhist "Monk", is actually "venerable". But nobody will know what the hell "Puli Space Venerable" would be so I made the creative decision to just rock Monk. Plus monk is such a badass word. 

I actually don't get upset or annoyed with people that dismiss and discredit artificial intelligence for filmmaking and artistry because I was actually in that same boat. And I want to give credit where credit is due, there's a filmmaker called "Kivan the kid", and watching his short film "echohunter" on YouTube in early/mid 2025 changed my mind completely about ai in art. Because the artistry was one man and so I'm watching one man's vision. And I thought about how it democratizes filmmaking. 

It's hard making a show by yourself. It's not just the audio and the editing and the constantly having to rewatched it, I must watch each episode probably more than 300 times before I release it fixing all the little tiny glitches and details as best as I can, and layering and all the sound effects. But it's even harder updating of the IMDB, posting everything, updating and building website, to be honest if I knew how hard it was from the get-go I probably wouldn't have done it. 

But I love the little world I created and the characters. Even if it never gets popular or big it's still quite magical and special to me.
