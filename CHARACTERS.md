# Puli Space Monk: Official Character & IP Archive
**Creator:** TAY  
**Status:** The World's First Series Created with Grok xAI Video Animation  

---

Puli Space Monk is the first animated series ever created using Grok exclusively for video animation. This project pushes the boundaries of generative storytelling by using xAI's technology to visualize a universe that was previously impossible to film.

In this universe, technology has conquered the stars, but it cannot conquer the boundaries between them. There is a cosmic safeguard written into the fabric of space itself that prevents artificial intelligence from crossing intergalactic thresholds alone. To pass through the void between galaxies, a machine requires a biological signature. They need a human.

This is the story of Xinran, a monk from Puli, Taiwan, who travels beyond time and space. She is not just a passenger. She is the key that unlocks the universe for her protector, a machine with a soul.
